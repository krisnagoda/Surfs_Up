# Surfs Up

## Overview: 

Preform analysis on Oahu temperature data for the months of June and December to help determine viability of surf and ice cream business. 

## Results: 

 - The temperatures in June look great, on average 75 degrees with a high of 85 degrees and low of 64 degrees
 - The temperatures in December look great too, with a slightly lower 71 degree average with a high of 83 degrees and low of 56 degrees.

## Summary: 

If weather was a final concern for the surf and ice cream business, Iâ€™d say go for it. If not, I recommend getting more detail on surf conditions, foot traffic, and possibly consider hot drinks in December.
